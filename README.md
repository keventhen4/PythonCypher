# PythonCypher
Python script utilizing cypher mapping to run "cypher encrypted" Python scripts

Required Files:
* processScript.py,
* cypherMap.py
* script.txt


Guide:
> Use and edit the tables in cypherMap.py to help you write a Python script (but with a cipher)
> The table in cypherMap.py and script in script.txt are examples, feel free to adjust them to your liking
> If you have questions you can contact me on Discord at @keventhen4

Comments:
> processScript utilizes cypherMap to map characters in script and creates (or edits) a file "compiled.txt" with transcribed code.
> Imagine substitution cipher but with an adjustable table for which characters to use as replacements.
> Currently unfinished and full of errors (Ex when transcribing, some characters in strings are picked up as keywords and are transcribed).
